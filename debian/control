Description: NVIDIA Communication Collectives Library (NCCL) Runtime
 NCCL (pronounced "Nickel") is a stand-alone library of standard collective
 communication routines,such as all-gather, reduce, broadcast, etc., that have
 been optimized to achieve high bandwidth over PCIe. NCCL supports up to eight
 GPUs and can be used in either single- or multi-process (e.g., MPI)
 applications.
